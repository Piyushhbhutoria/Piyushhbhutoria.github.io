intro:
  - line: A Tech-enthusiast who loves skating, coding and problem solving. Self taught developer, always exploring new places both personally and professionally. 
  - line: I was a sportsperson all my school days and the ‘guy in the chair’ during my college days. I’ve always tried to build a broad perspective on problems and solutions by exploring multiple domains like design, development and management. With that being said, I’ve a strong inclination towards startups and innovation, and I’m always on a look out for the next big thing.
